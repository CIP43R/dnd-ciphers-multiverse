## About

This is an adaption of the official dnd 5e system, but modified for my personal use in one of my campaigns. It replaces most races, classes and items and introduces an entirely new universe, features and more.

I took my inspiration from Star Trek, Star Wars, Dune, Destiny (the game) and the Expanse.

## Rules and changes
Every 5e rule and content applies unless overridden by the rules in this system. The following rules have been added/removed/adjusted:

- Races and Classes can both have **requirements**
- Races and Classes are fully being replaced by those in the respective folders, except for **Human**
- Weapons are all being replaced. The original DND 5e weapons might be existent as historical weapons or in different, more modern forms
- Lots of different Vehicles were added, allowing faster travel on plants and around the universe
- The combat system has been reworked - please see [[Conditions, diseases and wounds]]
- New [[Ability Scores & Skills]] have been added

## TODOs for world building

May contain spoilers for my next campaign!

Elements to introduce:
- Religious, mysterious cults

- Add descriptions for appearances
- Warframe stuff

Relations for classes and races (or at least my attempts for it):
- Scavengers are inspired by the Artificer
- Medics are inspired by Cleric
- Mercenary is inspired by the Barbarian
- Navigator is completely unrelated
- Nomad is inspired by Ranger and Rouge
- Scout is inspired by Rogue and Ranger
- Soldier is inspired by Fighter
- Trahen Cordis is inspired by Warlock
- The Sulvex and Umbrynn are supposed to relate to the druid

TBD: Wizard, Bard (or some kind of support)
