# About

This is an adaption of the official dnd 5e system, but modified for my personal use in one of my campaigns. It replaces most races, classes and items and introduces an entirely new universe, features and more.

### Rules
Every 5e rule applies unless overridden by the rules in this system (see rules folder).

#### Classes and races
All 5e classes and races will be replaced by those in the respective folders, except for human.

## TODO
Elements to introduce:
- Religious, mysterious cults
- Space pirates and combats
- Make certain races allergic to certain medicine
