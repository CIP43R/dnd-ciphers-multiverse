Some factions and planets in the galaxy have different currencies, but most of them, use Shards as common currency.  

| Faction                | Currency | Planets included | Species variety |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| United Planet Alliance | Shards   | 3071             | 51              |
|                        |          |                  |                 |




However, there are local currencies for specific factions, for example (but not limited to):

- Terran solars (currency used by terrans, residents of terran sol)
-
