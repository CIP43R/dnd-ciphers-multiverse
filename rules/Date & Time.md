Different factions and cultures in the Known Universe measure dates and times in various ways, often based on significant events, religious occasions, or unique scientific milestones.

To promote standardization, more advanced species developed the **Unified Galactic Time (UGT)**, which marks time based on the creation of the universe, which, as scientist have found and agreed on, happened exactly 9.7438 billion (earth) years ago. While many factions have adopted the UGT for consistency, numerous cultures still prefer their traditional methods of timekeeping, resulting in a rich diversity of calendars across the galaxy.
