While the original [conditions](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#content) apply, certain wounds, diseases, and conditions in this system can be especially dangerous and may require specific treatments. **Medical expertise** or **healing items** are essential for managing critical injuries until a doctor can be found. Fortunately, doctors are available on most planets and space stations, though their services often come at a cost. With caution, most critical injuries can be avoided, reducing the need for immediate medical intervention.

As in the original rules, a **disease** is a **condition** that can inflict damage or other negative effects over time, though it doesn’t need to stem from weapons or environmental hazards. Not every disease is curable, and some may require specialized treatment.
### Wounds
When a player takes damage, there is a chance it may leave a **wound**, which can cause additional HP loss and sometimes lead to **conditions** or **diseases**. There are various types of wounds, and while most are treatable, this system includes no single class or spell capable of curing _all_ wounds easily. Instead, certain wounds require specific tools, materials, or expertise.
#### Critical Wounds and Conditions

Some wounds and conditions caused by weapons or environmental hazards require **professional medical treatment** and are considered **critical**. If left untreated or improperly treated, a critical wound will cause progressive HP loss, which can be affected by factors such as wound severity and the patient’s race.

If treated by a professional with the appropriate tools and materials, critical wounds can usually be stabilized, preventing further consequences. Technically, anyone can attempt treatment, but doing so without proper skill and equipment greatly increases the risk to the patient.

**Example:** A character without medical training attempting to treat inner wounds might face several Medicine skill checks with a high DC (30), and each failed check could worsen the patient’s condition.

> **Note:** Certain races may experience different effects from the same injuries. For instance, Draconics possess strong self-healing abilities, making them less prone to infections.

|Condition|Required Treatment|Possible Consequences|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|Inner wounds|Surgery|Progressive HP loss based on severity; may lead to organ failure.|Injured organs|
|Poisoning|Antidote|Incorrect antidotes can worsen symptoms; some toxins may cause long-term effects.||
|Radiation|Specialized Medication|Over- or under-dosing carries significant risks.||
|Deep wounds|Medical kit, sometimes surgery|Blood loss, infection, worsening of wounds|Ammunition or projectiles lodged in wound|
|Infection|Medication|Incorrect medication or improper dosing can worsen the condition.|Infected wounds, biological diseases|
|Severe burns|Surgery|Steady HP loss; high infection risk; may leave the target [Incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#content).|Fire or chemical burns|

#### Uncritical Wounds and Conditions

**Uncritical wounds** only cause HP loss at the time of injury, without ongoing effects that drain HP if left untreated. Simple [[Items#Medical items|items]] such as Stimpacks or Biogel are generally sufficient to treat these injuries. However, depending on the individual’s race, even uncritical wounds may pose additional risks.

Untreated uncritical wounds may still become critical over time, potentially causing more severe conditions.

|Condition|Examples|Can Become Critical if Untreated|
|---|---|---|
|Outer wounds|Light scratches, mild burns|No|
|Superficial wounds|Glancing shots|Yes|
|Immune reactions|Cancer|Yes|
