Every vehicle has Hit Points like the characters do. If a vehicle's HP falls to 0, it is being considered to be beyond repair. If a vehicle suffers damage, it might not be usable anymore depending on the situation. [Engineers](Engineer) can repair vehicles and [Navigators](Navigator) are proficient in piloting them. Some vehicles can be maneuvered by everyone while others are too complicated and trying to pilot them without a Navigator could cause dangerous situations.
