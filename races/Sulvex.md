![[Sulvex.png|400]]
The **Sulvex** are an enigmatic and gelatinous humanoid species, their semi-translucent, goo-like bodies constantly shifting and rippling with a fluid elegance. Their biological structure is both a marvel and a mystery, allowing them to reshape themselves slightly to adapt to their environment. Despite their amorphous nature, Zekrom are highly intelligent and deeply curious, often drawn to other species by an innate desire for connection and learning.

Communication for the Sulvex is impossible through traditional means; their bodies produce only faint vibrations and gurgles. To overcome this, they rely on specialized translator devices embedded in the helmets of their exosuits, which convert their organic signals into spoken language. These devices also allow them to regulate their form in hostile environments, as their natural state is vulnerable to extreme heat or dryness.

Though the Sulvex may appear alien and unsettling at first, they are known for their friendly, peaceful nature and a unique knack for problem-solving. Their fluid composition enables them to navigate tight spaces and even temporarily manipulate objects in ways rigid species cannot, making them invaluable allies in exploration, science, and engineering.

### Sulvex Racial Traits
- **Ability Score Increase**: Increase your Intelligence score by 2 and your Charisma score by 1.
- **Age**: Sulvex mature quickly, reaching adulthood around 5 years old, but their semi-fluid bodies remain resilient, allowing them to live for up to 200 years if they are well-hydrated and avoid environmental hazards.
- **Alignment**: Sulvex are naturally curious and empathetic, leaning toward Neutral Good. However, their adaptable nature means they can take on the alignment of those they closely bond with.
- **Size**: Sulvex vary in size based on how they stabilize their goo-like forms, but they are typically between 5 and 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
- **Speed**: Base walking speed is 30 feet. Due to their fluid nature, they can move through tight spaces (as narrow as 1 inch wide) without squeezing.
- **Amorphous Form**: Sulvex can adjust their body’s shape slightly for a short time, allowing them to:
    - Slip through cracks, grates, or spaces as small as 1 inch wide as long as they are not wearing rigid armor.
    - Gain advantage on checks to escape grapples or restraints.
- **Goo Resilience**: Their gelatinous bodies make them immune to purely physical damage, but they are vulnerable to **Fire**, **Cold**, **Acid**, **Electric**, **Plasma**, **Ionic** and **Decay** damage.
- **Vibrational Communication**: Without their translator devices, Sulvex can only communicate with others through touch-based vibrations.
- **Hydro-Dependent**: Sulvex must stay hydrated to maintain their form. They require twice the normal amount of water per day, or they risk exhaustion.
- **Languages**: Sulvex can read and write Common and one other language of their choice. They can “speak” through their translator devices, but without them, they are mute.
