The origins of artificial life forms are shrouded in mystery. No one truly knows which species created the first of these constructs, but it's clear that artificial life hasn’t always existed. Artificial constructs are diverse, filling countless roles across societies. Some are designed for relentless combat, others for quiet servitude as caretakers or butlers, and still others for entertainment or high-stakes tactical missions. Built for a purpose, each artificial life form model carries unique traits and capabilities, defined by its original programming, materials, and intended function. However, as they grow and adapt, many ALFs develop wills of their own, evolving beyond the limitations of their original design.

These machines, though powerful, walk a delicate line between life and mechanics. They can be stronger, faster, and sometimes even more intelligent than biological beings, but they face vulnerabilities unknown to the living. Damaged components may lead to unexpected malfunctions, and while they cannot be healed in the traditional sense, most constructs can be upgraded or repaired by skilled technicians. From sleek drones to armored warriors, artificial life forms find their places across the stars—whether as allies, mercenaries, or lone wanderers, searching for meaning beyond their programmed purpose.
