The **Draconics** are one of the few ancient species in the universe who have managed to harmonize their advanced knowledge of interstellar travel with a simple, nature-bound way of life. Spread across over 36 stellar systems, they have colonies on diverse worlds, yet they leave each planetâ€™s natural ecosystem almost untouched. For the Draconics, existence is guided by a single creed: they are guests of nature, bound to take only what is freely given. Rather than imposing artificial structures, they mold their lives around the natural landscapes, adapting to their surroundings rather than altering them. Their appearance resembles that of the ancient dragons as their name proclaims.

Their ships, weapons, and other technological marvels are unlike anything else seen across the stars. Composed of living tissue, these creations appear almost organic, as if they were grown rather than built. These biological technologies are mysterious to outsiders, seeming to be both alive and engineered for specific functions. The Draconics keep the methods behind these innovations strictly guarded; while other species are welcomed warmly to their colonies, none are permitted to learn the secrets of their living tech.

With their unique blend of wisdom and strength, the Draconics inspire both wonder and respect. They prioritize balance in all things, seeing themselves as both protectors of life and explorers of the universe. They are patient yet fierce guardians of their own lands, and their powerful ships are respected across the galaxy, not only for their capabilities but also for the ancient mystery they represent.
