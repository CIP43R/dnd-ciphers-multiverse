![[Vyrrai.png|400]]
The **Vyrrai** are a shadow-born species, their gaunt, skeletal forms radiating an aura of dread. Their skin, a mottled grey or ashen black, clings tightly to their wiry frames, giving them an undead appearance that unnerves most who encounter them. With hollow, lightless eyes and movements more akin to stalking predators than humanoids, the Vyrrai embody the terror of the unseen.

The Vyrrai hail from the lightless caverns of **’Vythra Prime**, a dying world consumed by endless night and shrouded in heavy, poisonous mists. Their society is as unforgiving as their environment, with sprawling, hive-like nests ruled by matriarchs who control their kin through fear and ferocity. The Vyrrai revere darkness as a sacred force, believing it to be both a shield and a weapon. To them, light is a cruel affliction, weakening their bodies and exposing them to danger.

Stealthy and vicious, the Vyrrai are master ambushers, using their natural affinity for darkness to strike swiftly and without warning. Their predatory instincts are tempered by a brutal cunning, allowing them to exploit weaknesses in their prey with terrifying precision. They are feared across the universe not just for their brutality, but for the eerie silence that precedes their attacks—a creeping dread that heralds certain death.

The Vyrrai hold little regard for other species, seeing them either as prey or as pawns to be manipulated. Yet among their own kind, loyalty to the nest is paramount, and betrayal is met with swift and merciless judgment. While the Vyrrai may appear as little more than monstrous hunters, their intelligence and cunning make them a force to be reckoned with in the shadows of the galaxy.
