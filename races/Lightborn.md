The **Lightborn** are a radiant, ethereal race distinguished by their luminous eyes and skin that seems to glow with an inner light. Their appearance, often described as celestial or otherworldly, has led many to view them as beings touched by divine energies. Known for their gentle and peaceful nature, the Lightborn are devoted to a way of life rooted in simplicity and balance.

The Lightborn believe in a harmonious universe governed by a pantheon of deities, each overseeing different aspects of existence, from life and growth to wisdom and justice. Rather than following elaborate doctrines, their faith is rooted in reverence for life’s natural rhythms and cycles. To the Lightborn, complexity is a sign of distraction from the true path, and they find enlightenment in quiet reflection and living in tune with the world around them.

Lightborn communities are serene, often built to seamlessly blend with nature, where members practice modesty, humility, and compassion. Though they prefer peaceful resolutions, Lightborn are not without strength—they possess powerful light-based abilities that can both heal and protect. However, they wield these gifts sparingly, believing that true strength lies in understanding and harmony rather than conflict.

Those who encounter the Lightborn are often captivated by their radiance and inspired by their unwavering dedication to a life of purity and spiritual integrity. To walk among them is to see the world through a lens of simplicity, faith, and inner peace.
