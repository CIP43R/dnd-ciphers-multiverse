![[Umbrynn.png|400]]
The **Umbrynn** are enigmatic beings of pure spirit, existing as formless shades that drift unseen through the universe. In their natural state, they are faint, mist-like entities, their presence marked only by a subtle ripple in the air and a feeling of warmth or calm. Despite their incorporeal nature, the Umbrynn are deeply compassionate and crave the connection and sensation of a physical existence. They possess a remarkable ability to inhabit the bodies of willing hosts, forging a symbiotic bond that enhances both the shade and the vessel.

When an Umbrynn possesses a host, the host’s physical form changes, reflecting the ethereal presence within. Umbrynns connecting to normal animals will transform into anthropomorphic versions of themselves, gaining humanoid features such as upright posture and articulate hands, while humanoid hosts exhibit a subtle but distinct shift in appearance. This can manifest as glowing patterns on their skin, slightly altered facial features, or an aura of otherworldly grace. These changes mark the bond between host and Umbrynn, a fusion of physical and spiritual energy.

The relationship between an Umbrynn and its host is one of profound trust and mutual respect. The Umbrynn never possess a creature without explicit consent, viewing such an act as a grave violation of their moral code. Once bonded, the Umbrynn shares its wisdom, experience, and unique abilities with the host, while the host provides the physical form the Umbrynn lacks. Together, they live as one, experiencing the world in harmony until the vessel’s natural end. When this occurs, the Umbrynn departs peacefully, often leaving behind a legacy of kindness and heroism. Thanks to the powerful mind of the Umbrynn, the life span of a host is being extended tremendously. If an ongoing bond with a vessel is being torn apart before it's natural end, it causes stress to both parts of the symbiosis, resulting in the ultimate decay of both souls.

Despite their benevolence, the Umbrynn are often misunderstood or feared by those unfamiliar with their nature. Some societies revere them as wise guardians or spiritual guides, while others shun or hunt them, mistaking their possession for malevolent control. Regardless, the Umbrynn remain steadfast in their kindness, offering guidance and companionship to those who accept them, and wandering the cosmos in search of connection.

#### Choose Form
At 1st level, based on your background you either choose to wander around in your Ethereal Form to find a host or you start with a symbiont.

#### Ethereal Form
When not possessing a host, you are in your true, ethereal form. In this form:
- You have a flying speed of 30 feet in any direction.
- You can pass through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain.
- You are immune to any damage but cannot interact with the physical world.
- You can use the **Umbrynn Symbiosis** trait.

#### Umbrynn Symbiosis
When in your Ethereal form, as an action, you can attempt to inhabit the body of a willing living creature you can see and touch within 5 feet. The creature must consent to this willingly (you cannot possess an unwilling creature). The chance that a potential host agrees to a symbioses depends on their **background**, **level** and **Wisdom** ability score. When in symbiosis:
- You and your host share control of the body, working in tandem.
- The host will start with level 1.
- You use the host's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and proficiencies, while retaining your own mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) and proficiencies.
- You and the host can telepathically communicate with each other.
- You use their HP. If the host HP fall to 0, your bond with the host will be broken and you return to the Ethereal Form, loosing all physical ability scores, proficiencies, items and other things related to the host. The host will not transform back into their original form.
- You can choose the host's class unless they have a background providing a class

#### Suspend Symbiosis
At 2nd level, as an action you can suspend the band of your symbiose for the equivalent of 3 turns to turn back into **Ethereal Form**. While your bond will be suspended, it is not gone yet. Every turn, your host takes 1d4 decay damage. In the 4th turn you have to use your action and be in reach of your host to perform the **Umbrynn Symbiosis** or else you and your host will die ultimately.
