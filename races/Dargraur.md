The **Dargraur** are a proud and imposing species, their pale, almost silver-toned skin a reflection of their harsh, frigid homeworld, **Thaldris Vaal**. Towering and powerfully built, the Dargraur are known as relentless warriors, combining physical prowess with an unshakable code of honor. Their piercing eyes, often icy blue or stark white, seem to carry the cold resolve of their dark, frozen planet, and their stark, angular features give them a regal, if intimidating, presence.

On **Thaldris Vaal**, survival is a test of endurance and strength. Over centuries, the Dargraur honed their martial traditions, valuing personal combat as the ultimate expression of skill and integrity. Their empire, built on the foundation of their natural resources and mastery of technology, became the birthplace of **HexCorp™**, a galactic powerhouse in the production of advanced military weaponry and cutting-edge technology. HexCorp™ is feared and respected across the known universe, its weapons synonymous with efficiency and devastation.

Despite their industrial might, the Dargraur hold tightly to their warrior traditions. Among their most sacred rituals is the **Rites of the Kraal’zar**, a life-or-death duel fought with their ancestral melee weapon, the **Vargrin**. These blade-staff hybrids, forged from the unbreakable metals of Thaldris Vaal, are as much a symbol of honor as they are tools of war. The Dargraur see dueling not as barbaric but as a purification—a way to resolve disputes, prove worthiness, or seek redemption.

While many see the Dargraur as cold and merciless, those who earn their respect discover an unshakable ally. They prize loyalty and skill, treating their comrades with reverence and their enemies with uncompromising severity. To face a Dargraur in combat is to confront the embodiment of calculated strength and unwavering resolve.
