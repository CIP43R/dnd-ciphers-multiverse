The **Velkaar** are widely regarded as the bravest and most formidable warriors in the known universe. From the age of ten, every Velkaar child is subjected to a grueling military training regimen that shapes them into disciplined soldiers by the time they reach eighteen. Only after surviving these relentless trials are they permitted to choose a specialty, though the majority elect to dedicate their lives to the infamous **Velkaarian Imperial Army**—a legion feared for its ruthless efficiency and unyielding brutality.

Having conquered numerous planets, the Velkaar have established colonies at the farthest reaches of the galaxy, imposing their law and order with an iron fist. Their empire is vast, and their reputation is as powerful as their warriors. However, after a long and bloody history of conflict, the Velkaar eventually brokered a truce with the **Unified Planetary Alliance** to prevent direct war. This agreement has kept open warfare at bay, but relations remain tense: the Velkaar hold little respect for most other species and often view any challenge to their authority with contempt. Their intolerance and rigid code of honor mean they have few allies and make them a daunting force on any battlefield.

The Velkaar value strength and loyalty above all else, and their society reflects this; to them, weakness is unforgivable, and any who fail to meet their standards are cast out. Their culture is both feared and respected, and their armies are rarely defeated. While peace holds for now, it is an uneasy one, and many suspect that the Velkaar’s imperial ambitions may one day lead them to test the limits of the truce.
