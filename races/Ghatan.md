![[Ghatan.png|400]]
The **Ghatan** are a methodical and disciplined species, feared as much for their cunning as for their commanding presence. With smooth, slate-colored skin ranging from deep charcoal to pale ashen hues, and angular, chiseled features, the Ghatan evoke an air of detached superiority. Their piercing, gemstone-like eyes shimmer faintly in dim light, as though always watching and weighing those around them. Every movement they make is deliberate, every word spoken with purpose, embodying their species’ deep-seated belief in the supremacy of order and precision.

Hailing from the volcanic, labyrinthine world of **Drahvas Nahl**, the Ghatan were shaped by an environment of extremes—where survival required not just strength but sharp wits and unyielding discipline. This harsh upbringing forged a people who value control above all else: control over themselves, over their society, and over others. Their hierarchical culture is built on rigid structures, with power concentrated in the hands of a few who lead with ruthless efficiency. To the Ghatan, chaos is anathema, and they view the imposition of order—by any means necessary—as their rightful duty.

The Ghatan are master tacticians, adept at both warfare and diplomacy. They have an uncanny ability to read the motivations and weaknesses of others, using subtle influence and psychological acumen to achieve their goals. While their technology is advanced, their greatest weapon is their ability to outthink and outmaneuver their foes, often winning battles before the first strike is made. Many fear their cold, calculating approach, as they are known to see other species not as equals but as pawns in a grander game of dominance and expansion.

Despite their reputation for cruelty, the Ghatan see their actions as justified, even noble. They view themselves as architects of stability, carving order from chaos wherever they go. Whether feared or respected, one thing is certain: the Ghatan leave a lasting mark on every corner of the universe they touch.

- **Steel Resolve:** Growing up in a rigid hierarchy, the Ghatan develop a high tolerance for physical discomfort and pain. When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you may instead drop to 1 hit point. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
