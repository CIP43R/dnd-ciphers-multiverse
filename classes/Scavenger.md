Scavengers are rugged outlanders who roam the planets, gathering every usable resource, regardless of how worn or broken it might be. Known for their unmatched skill in repurposing scraps and salvaging value from others’ leftovers, Scavengers are resourceful survivors capable of transforming the discarded into the indispensable. They often live solitary lives on the fringes of society, though some band together into notorious factions, gaining a reputation for fierce rivalries and bitter territorial disputes. Whether they’re lone wolves or faction members, Scavengers bring a practical ingenuity and unyielding resilience to any situation, turning the cast-offs of civilization into tools for survival.

### Scrap Collector
Scavengers are adept at finding valuable materials and scraps, even in unlikely places. They gain advantage on Investigation and Perception checks to locate hidden items, useful scraps, or salvageable tech in any environment.

### Makeshift mechanic
Starting at 1st level, you can use this ability to repair simple [vehicles](vehicles). The required time, materials and types of vehicles you can repair depends on your level. If a vehicle has less than 1/3 of it's original HP, it is considered to be beyond repair. Repairing a vehicle restores it's HP.

| Vehicle              | Level required to repair | Time required             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Simple spacevehicles | 1                        | 30 minutes per HP missing |
| TODO                 |                          |                           |
### Specialized tinkerer
Scavengers can use spare materials to create basic items. With the right ingredients, you can assemble weapons, traps, tools and more, depending on their specialization, which you choose at 1st level. Choosing different types of materials can make the trap more or less effective, possibly creating additional effects.
#### Trapsetter
You gained expertise in creating traps. A trap always needs a *triggering mechanism* and a *load*. When the triggering mechanism activates, the load is being emitted or used. If possible, you can use any triggering mechanism for any trap, i.e. laser sensor, string, etc. Some traps require additional materials.
