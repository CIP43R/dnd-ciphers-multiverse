> **This class is only available if you choose the Sha'ayra faction actively or at least have a background including it.**

The Sha'ayra is a clandestine sisterhood dedicated to harnessing and safeguarding a form of energy they call the _Astral Thread_. This ancient order believes the Thread connects all living things to the dimensions, stars and planets, forming a cosmic web that spans the entire multiverse. Through years of intense meditation, training, and rituals, each member of the covenant learns to see, touch, and manipulate these Astral Threads to wield subtle yet powerful influences.

The Sha'ayra exist beyond the bounds of most political alliances, even seen as myth by some. It is a whisper in the dark, a legend, and yet their mark is found on planets across the stars. They avoid direct conflict whenever possible, preferring to weave fate from the shadows and instill balance where they see it lacking. They have a strict hierarchy and follow the lead of their all-mother at all times.

### Abilities and Powers
- **Threadsight**: Members can enter a trance state in which they can perceive the Astral Threads that connect everything. You can concentrate to use this ability, allowing you to detect emotions, read the faint impressions of recent events, or even catch glimpses of other worlds.
	- Level 2: Trained members of the Sha'ayra can use this power to communicate across great distances or guide allies with a form of astral intuition.
	- Level 4: You gained enough experience to sharpen your senses. You can read the intention of any living creature within 15 feet.
- **Fateweaving**: Covenant members learn how to gently tug on the astral threads to influence the probabilities around them. As an action, you can grant *minor luck* to allies or *misfortune* to enemies within 15 feet range. Minor luck grants advantage on the next 10 rolls while misfortune causes disadvantage on the next 10 rolls. You can't use Fateweaving again until you take a long rest.
	- Level 5: You have become one with the astral planes, weaving the threads of fate is like breathing. Fateweaving remains active permanently.
- **Astral shroud**: By pulling the Astral Threads around themselves, members can become partially obscured, appearing as a shimmering outline or even vanishing briefly from sight. This power helps the Elarian Covenant maintain their secrecy and avoid detection when observing, infiltrating, or escaping.
