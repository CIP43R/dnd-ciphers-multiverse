Engineers are masters of creation and innovation, blending technical prowess with practical ingenuity. Their expertise ranges from constructing advanced androids to maintaining spaceships, crafting devastating weapons, and designing intricate tools. Engineers thrive on problem-solving, using their inventions and quick thinking to overcome challenges in combat and exploration.

Engineers are versatile support characters with a balance of utility and combat potential. Depending on their specialization, they can repair vehicles, enhance weapons, deploy artificial constructs, or disable enemy systems.
