In the endless, sprawling reaches of the multiverse, threats to life abound: unknown pathogens, strange toxins, and weapons capable of harm beyond imagination. Amidst warring species, volatile environments, and hazardous technologies, Doctors are the stalwart guardians of life and health. They wield a blend of medical expertise, alchemical knowledge, and, in some cases, advanced technology to mend bodies and protect minds.

Whether on the battlefield, aboard a starship, or within alien landscapes, a Doctor’s skills are invaluable. They cure rare diseases, neutralize potent poisons, and stabilize those on the brink of death. Most ancient ailments may have known treatments, but the multiverse is rife with new and evolving dangers, and a Doctor's work is never done. Their practice is a blend of science and adaptability, enabling them to meet the needs of countless worlds, species, and cultures with precision and care.
