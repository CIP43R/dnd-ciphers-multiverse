The Scout is a versatile, stealth-oriented class focused on exploration, information gathering, and sabotage. They are adept with high-tech drones and hacking tools, allowing them to bypass security, sabotage enemy equipment, and gather intel without being seen. They often operate as the eyes and ears of an adventuring party, scouting hostile territory, mapping unknown areas, and disabling security systems. The Scout might also be a master of terrain navigation, survival tactics, and quiet takedowns.
