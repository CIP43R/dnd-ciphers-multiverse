With the dawn of interstellar travel, navigating the vast unknown of the universe became an essential skill. Navigators serve as indispensable guides through the cosmos, maneuvering through asteroid fields, charting new worlds, and leading expeditions across celestial landscapes. Their expertise in ship handling, astronomical phenomena, and gravitational forces allows them to operate with unmatched precision. While others see the stars as distant pinpoints, Navigators understand the invisible currents and hazards of space, making them essential to any journey.
