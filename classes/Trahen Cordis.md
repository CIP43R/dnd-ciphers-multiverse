> **This class is only available if you choose the Trahen Cordis faction actively or at least have a background including it. You must fulfill the requirements that come with this class if you want to play it.**

The Trahen Cordis is a clandestine order dedicated to harnessing and safeguarding a form of energy they call the _Astral Thread_. This ancient order believes the Threads connect all living things to the dimensions, stars and planets, forming a cosmic web that spans the entire multiverse. Through years of intense meditation, training, and rituals, each member of the covenant learns to see, touch, and manipulate these Astral Threads to wield subtle yet powerful influences.

The Trahen Cordis exist beyond the bounds of most political alliances, even seen as myth by some. It is a whisper in the dark, a legend, and yet their mark is found on planets across the stars. They avoid direct conflict whenever possible, preferring to weave fate from the shadows and instill balance where they see it lacking. They have a strict hierarchy and follow the lead of their all-mother at all times.

#### Astral Shroud

You have to step back into this world if you want to interact with it, meaning that you cannot interact with any presence or item while Astral Shroud is active.
