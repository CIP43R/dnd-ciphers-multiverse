There are many different cultures in the known universe, one more mysterious than the others. Their influence and powers vary, and being part of a faction clearly doesn't only grant advantages. Some factions have set very tough requirements to join, some might be only open to those who were born into them. Wars have been fought between factions and are still going. As part of such cultures or factions, every decision you make can have even higher consequences. 

*Joining a faction or culture is optional and restricts other portions of character creation. It comes with strong advantages, but every advantage has it's counter-part.*

### Hermetic Order of the Void
**The Hermetic Order of the Void** is a secretive and fanatical cult that venerates an otherworldly deity known as **The Creator**. According to their belief, The Creator brought all things into existence from nothingness. They claim The Creator resides in a plane that lies between the everything and nothing—the Void, from where he can create and destroy. To them, the Void is not mere emptiness, but a powerful realm where creation and destruction converge. The Order believes that those who can access the Void and embrace its energy transcend the limits of the physical world, tapping into the very fabric of existence and wielding its fundamental power.

### Trahen Cordis
The Trahen Cordis is a clandestine order dedicated to harnessing and safeguarding a form of energy they call the _Astral Thread_. This ancient order believes the Thread connects all living things to the dimensions, stars and planets, forming a cosmic web that spans the entire multiverse. Through years of intense meditation, training, and rituals, each member of the covenant learns to see, touch, and manipulate these Astral Threads to wield subtle yet powerful influences.

The Trahen Cordis exist beyond the bounds of most political alliances, even seen as myth by some. It is a whisper in the dark, a legend, and yet their mark is found on planets across the stars. They avoid direct conflict whenever possible, preferring to weave fate from the shadows and instill balance where they see it lacking. They have a strict hierarchy and follow the lead of their all-mother at all times.

### Velkaar
**The Velkaar** are an elite, militaristic race of hardened warriors and disciplined soldiers who have dedicated their lives to mastering the art of war. Originating from a long-forgotten, war-torn world, they are relentless in their pursuit of power and honor through combat. The Velkaar value strength, precision, and loyalty above all else, and their name strikes fear into those who know them.

Their society is built on a strict hierarchy, where only the strongest and most skilled rise to the top. They are fiercely loyal to their cause and will stop at nothing to achieve victory, no matter the cost. Trained from a young age in the ways of battle, the Velkaar are experts in all forms of combat, from close-quarters melee to long-range precision strikes.

Their culture is one of rigid discipline and sacrifice, and they view their warriors as instruments of divine purpose, chosen to enforce the will of the higher powers they worship. It is said that their warriors are not born, but forged in the crucible of war, tempered by hardship and sacrifice.

Though they are often hired as mercenaries, many factions fear them due to their unwavering fanaticism and unmatched combat prowess. The Velkaar believe that through war, they will achieve transcendence and bring order to a chaotic universe—an order that is written in the blood of their enemies.

Few dare to challenge the Velkaar on the battlefield, for to do so is to invite a brutal, unrelenting campaign that will stop at nothing to crush all opposition.
