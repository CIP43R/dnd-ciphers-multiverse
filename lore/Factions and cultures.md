There are many different cultures in the known universe, one more mysterious than the others. Their influence and powers vary, and being part of a faction clearly doesn't only grant advantages. Some factions have set very tough requirements to join, some might be only open to those who were born into them. Wars have been fought between factions and are still going. As part of such cultures or factions, every decision you make can have even higher consequences. 

*Joining a faction or culture is optional and restricts other portions of character creation. It comes with strong advantages, but every advantage has it's counter-part.*
