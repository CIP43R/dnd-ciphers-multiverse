In the vast expanse of The Known Universe, countless worlds drift among the stars, each a unique testament to the boundless creativity and chaos of existence. It is a realm where the tangible meets the ephemeral, and the line between reality and dreams blurs into a tapestry of colors and possibilities. While the denizens of this universe have long gazed upward, pondering the mysteries of the cosmos, they remain acutely aware of their limitations in understanding the full scope of what lies beyond their own realms.

The concept of a multiverse is not merely theoretical; it is woven into the very fabric of existence. Many cultures refer to the worlds around us as **The Known Universe**, acknowledging that they share a reality filled with diverse experiences and perspectives. However, little is understood about the realms that may lie beyond their immediate comprehension. The Sisterhood of Trahen Cordis believes that what they call the **Astral Threads**, serves as the connective fabric between these realms, guiding the fates of all beings, while a divergent philosophy is embraced by the **Ascents**, a group of thinkers and spiritual leaders who assert that a divine creator has fashioned the universe and all its inhabitants. They speak of a singular, transcendent deity whose will is reflected in the order of the cosmos. This belief imbues their understanding of existence with a sense of purpose and destiny, setting them apart from those who seek to unravel the mysteries through exploration and inquiry. The Ascents view the Astral Threads not as a means to navigate the multiverse, but as manifestations of their godâ€™s design, guiding souls toward enlightenment and harmony.

The Known Universe is a realm of unimaginable diversity and wonder, where celestial phenomena paint the skies with breathtaking hues and alien landscapes challenge the very notions of life and reality. From the lush, bioluminescent jungles of distant worlds to the desolate beauty of barren wastelands, each planet offers its own secrets waiting to be discovered. Ancient ruins and artifacts litter the cosmos, remnants of civilizations that have risen and fallen, each with its own stories etched into the stones. At the heart of this universe lies the eternal search for meaning, driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore the unknown. **Travelers**, scholars, and many other occupants venture forth into the endless beauty of our worlds, seeking knowledge and experience. Each expedition holds the promise of discovery, yet also the potential for peril. In the pursuit of truth, many have encountered wonders beyond imagination, while others have succumbed to the darkness that lurks within the uncharted territories.
